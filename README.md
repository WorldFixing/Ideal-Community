# Ideal-Community
So if you could create the Ideal Community, How big would it be? How self-sufficient? How many people? 

Steps to find out:
  1) Fill out the InputForm1 for your best Guess - mostly percentages with just a few numbers.
  2) Then run the Calculate Ideal Community python program below to display your information.
  3) Then run the IdealCommunity program to compare what you imagined and the
  results from the Python program...

Our GitHub web site will have more details soon, to learn more about why this is the ideal community.
If you are interested in contributing, we are actively seeking volunteers to help - documentation,
the little things, or help us write many more, some rather big - the cause in right for today!
